## üîß Overview

**SSL-MoCo** is a two-step self-supervised framework for cardiac Cine MR image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. It does **not require any fully-sampled images** during training.

![Framework](./figs/fig_framework.png)
Fig.1 Proposed SSL-MoCo framework. (a) Step 1: Self-supervised image registration network with the photometric loss to minimize the differences between the reconstructed fixed image and the motion-corrected moving image. (b) Step 2: Self-supervised reconstruction network. Estimated motion fields from the first step are incorporated into the data consistency of the physics-based unrolled network using the forward and adjoint warp operations. The loss is composed of an image consistency loss and a cross k-space loss.

### Step 1: Self-supervised Image Registration

- Goal: learn non-rigid inter-frame motion
- Based on [GMA-RAFT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10491317)
- Reference images approximated by iterative SENSE reconstruction from undersampled k-space

### Step 2: Self-supervised Motion-compensated Reconstruction

- Goal: self-supervised motion-sompensated reconstruction
- Incorporate the learned motion into the data consistency layers of the unrolled reconstruction network
- Self-supervision through image consistency loss and cross k-space loss

## üìå Note

This repository **only contains the code for Step 2: self-supervised motion-compensated reconstruction**.

- The registration step is **not included** in this repository.  
- Please refer to the [GMARAFT](https://github.com/lab-midas/GMARAFT) implementation for motion estimation.  
- In our setting, since we do not have access to fully-sampled images, we approximate the reference using **iterative SENSE reconstruction** from undersampled k-space.
